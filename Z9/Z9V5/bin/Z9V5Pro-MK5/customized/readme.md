### Customized firmware for Z9V5Pro-MK5
The only different between Z9V5Pro-MK5 with Z9V5Pro-MK4 is equipped with different type of hot end for default, so you can use the same firmware with Z9V5Pro-MK4, but set the hot end type to "mixing" on LCD Menu(Menu: Control>>Configre>>Hotend Type:) after uploaded firmware.
